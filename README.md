# TCPSubscriberSystem
As part of a university assignment, the subscriber model was developed to highlight how to use the TCP protocol in C/C++. The client can subscribe to one or more topics, and he will be notified by the server when a change was made to that topic. The topics are created or changed by a python script that interacts with the server using UDP.
